1. Open Variables.java (under app/main/java/_training). What do you think this code does?
2. Run the code and see the result.

    - The code starts with "int" myNum and "int" myOtherNum. "int" stands for *integer*, which is a number without a decimal.
    - It then states the names after "int," which in this case are myNum and myOtherNum. The equals sign means it is this variable to something, saying it is equal to a value. This code sets the numbers to 1 and 2.
    - After this, it makes one last number, myFinalNum. It sets this number equal to the sum of myNum and myOtherNum. Thinking back on Algebra (ugh), you can substitute 1 for myNum and 2 for myOtherNum in the myFinalNum statement. It will become myFinalNum = 1 + 2.
    - The computer then prints the result!
3. Modify the code to include a third number that is multiplied by myFinalNum.

    - Hint: The sign for multiplication in Java is `*`, and Java follows Order of Operations (Parentheses, Multiplication / Division, Addition / Subtraction)

    - The solution is found in VariablesSolution.java

### Variable Types
#### String
  1. Add `String myText = "Hello!";` and `String myOtherText = "Again!";` to Variables.java.
      - A string represents a "string of characters." In other words, string is text!
 2. Add the two strings together into a new variable, myFinalText, and print it out.

     - `String myFinalText = myText + myOtherText;`
     - `System.out.println(myFinalText);`
     - Does it work?
     - What do you think is happening?
     - Try to fix it!

 When you are adding the two strings together, it adds "Hello!" and "Again!". There isn't a space inbetween, resulting in "Hello!Again!" You can fix it by adding a space after "Hello! " or before " Again!" View the solution if confused.

#### Float
 1. Add `float myDecimal = 2.5f;` and `float mySecondDecimal = 5.0f;` to Variables.java.

     - Float stands for "Floating-point decimal."
     - You must use an f after the number declaration, and it must be a decimal.

 2. Divide `myDecimal` by `mySecondDecimal` and store it in myLastDecimal, and print the output.

     - Hint: To divide in java, use `/`.
     - You should get 0.5, which is 1/2. This is true because 2.5 is half of 5.0.
#### Doubles
 1. Add `double myDoubleDecimal = 6.7;` and `double myOtherDouble = 4.1;`

     - A double is just a "*double*-length" float.
       - This means that doubles will be twice as accurate, but also require twice as much computer memory.
     - You do not need a suffix for numbers, because doubles are the widely accepted standard for numbers.
 2. Divide `myDoubleDecimal` by `myOtherDouble`, storing the result in myFinalDouble. Print the final output.

#### Bool
 1. Add the following code to Variables.java and run it.
 ```java
 boolean ateBreakfast = true;
 boolean ateLunch = true;
 boolean ateDinner = false;

 System.out.println(ateBreakfast && ateLunch);
 System.out.println(ateLunch && ateDinner);
 ```
 - A boolean is essentially a yes or no, but instead of yes, we say "true", and instead of no, we say "false".
 - The `&&` means "and." Look through the code. It prints out ateBreakfast && ateLunch, or ateBreakfast *and* ateLunch. We ate both of them (they both are true), so it will say true. Meanwhile, ateLunch is true, but ateDinner is *not*, so on the second print, we did *not* eat lunch and eat dinner.
 - We will talk more about booleans and logic soon.
